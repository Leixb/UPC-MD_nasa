This dataset gathers close to 10,000 observations made by NASA's 
Kepler Space Observatory in pursuit of finding new exoplanets that
could potentially be habitable. 
We obtained the dataset from Kaggle\footnote{Kepler Exoplanet Search Results 
dataset on Kaggle:
\url{https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results}},
the online data science and machine learning community.

9.564 observations were made by the Kepler observatory between 2009 and
2017, when this dataset was published, and all are contained in the dataset.
Moreover, it is comprised of 50 variables, most of them numerical and a few
categorical and boolean. Regarding missing data, overall there are 40.557 values
missing, or what is the same 8.48\% of the dataset. However, if we take out the
three variables that are largely missing: \texttt{kepler\_name}
(76.01\% missing), \texttt{koi\_teq\_err1}(100\% missing) and 
\texttt{koi\_teq\_err2}(100\% missing), the missing data drops
to just under 3.15\%.

Next, we'll look at the dataset's variables, what they mean, their kind
and what values they can take:

\subsection{Target variable}

In this dataset, the target of classification is quite clear:
\texttt{koi\_disposition}. This variable classifies the exoplanets into
four different categories:

    \paragraph{CANDIDATE} Observations that have yet to be studied
    
    \paragraph{FALSE POSITIVE} Observations that have been.
    
    \paragraph{CONFIRMED} Exoplanet observations that have been confirmed.
    
    \paragraph{NOT DISPOSITIONED} There are no entries with this variable since the Kepler satellite was decommissioned
    in November 2019, and all the data has already been classified in the other categories.
    
We won't  consider CANDIDATE exoplanets, as we want to train and test our models with
examples we know for sure are (CONFIRMED) or aren't (FALSE POSITIVE) exoplanets.
