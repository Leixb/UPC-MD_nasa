\subsection{Decision Trees}%
\label{sub:decision-trees}
We decided that in order to find the ideal depth of the decision tree, we had to try a range of values and pick the best performing one.

We tried all values between 1 and 50 and we found out that the best performing depth was around 5.

    \label{fig:decision_trees_acc}
\end{figure}

The resulting tree was surprisingly simple, and we could find very good leafs, with a gini index of 0 and 300+ samples in it and also pretty bad leafs

% Discussion of choice of parameters used. Try to interpret the obtained DT using some examples of the validation set. 
% Show some of the most relevant rules.  Discuss how + and â€“ examples are mixed in leaves in order to
% estimate the reliability of the tree.
